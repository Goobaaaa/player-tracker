# Development Requests for /dashboard and /tasks

I would like the following updates and improvements to be made to the system.

## Changes to `/dashboard` Page

1. **Task Modal Visibility**
   - Fix the issue where the task modal window does not appear in the userâ€™s viewport.
   - Currently, the screen blurs as if the modal should appear, but no task data is displayed.
   - Ensure the modal loads properly with full task details.

1. **Fix "View Comment" Button**
   - Restore functionality of the **View Comment** button so it works as it previously did.

2. **Fix Edit Button**
