# Development Requests for /dashboard and /tasks

I would like the following updates and improvements to be made to the system.

---

## Changes to `/dashboard` Page

1. **Responsive Task Modals**
   - Make task modal windows **relative to the userâ€™s viewport**, ensuring proper scaling and visibility across different screen sizes.

2. **Task Status Tags**
   - Display the **"Overdue"** and **"Active"** tags directly on each task card in the dashboard view.

## Changes to `/tasks` Page

1. **Restore Task Action Buttons**
   - Reintroduce the missing buttons on each task:
     - **Toggle Complete**
     - **View Comment**
     - **Edit**
     - **Delete (red button)**
