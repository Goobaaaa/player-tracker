# Development Requests for /dashboard and /tasks

I would like the following updates and improvements to be made to the system.

---

## Changes to `/dashboard` Page

1. **Collapsible Task Description**
   - Display only ~1 paragraph of the task description by default.
   - Add a toggle option for **"Show More" / "Show Less"** to expand or collapse the full description.

2. **Collapsible Comments**
   - Allow users to collapse and hide the task comments section.

3. **Thumbnail Hover Effects**
   - Remove the blur effect when hovering over image thumbnails.
   - Increase the **"Eye" icon size by 2x**.

4. **Open Images in New Tab**
   - Change the image thumbnail behavior so that clicking opens the image in a **new browser tab** instead of a modal window.

## Changes to `/tasks` Page

1. **Remove Task Name/Description in Comments**
   - Remove duplicate task name and description from the **Comments** section.
   - Instead, add a **"Show More" toggle** on the original task description to expand/collapse.

2. **Collapsible Comments**
   - Add functionality to collapse already posted comments so they can be hidden from the userâ€™s view.

3. **Thumbnail Hover Effects**
   - Remove the blur effect when hovering over images.
   - Increase the **"Eye" icon size by 2x**.

4. **Centered Modal Image View**
   - When opening images in a modal window:
     - Center the image within the viewport.
     - Remove the **"X" close button** in the top-right corner.
